             <p>M&M started to be a steel trading company in 1945 built by three brothers, K.C. Mahindra, J.C. Mahindra, and Malik Ghulan Mohammed. Its initial name then was Mahindra & Mohammed. Right after Indiaâ€™s Independence Day and Pakistan emerged to become a separate country, Mohammed fled to Pakistan. This led to the name change and became Mahindra & Mahindra in 1948.

                When the demand came for MUVs, M&M started to transform the business into a car company. The company then later moved on to making light commercial vehicles and agricultural tractors. As of today, M&M is considered as the key player in manufacturing utility vehicles with their first model, the Mahindra XUV500.
                
                The growth of the company did not stop there. Since the brothers wanted to venture on foreign markets and emerging industries, they bought Kinect Motors and started creating two-wheelers. They also have shared in the REVA Electric Car Company and later on bought the SsangYong Motor Company in 2011 from Korea.
